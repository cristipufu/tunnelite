Tunnelite is a .NET tool that lets you set up a secure connection between a public web address and an application running on your local machine. It effectively makes your local app accessible from the internet.

```bash
# macOS / Linux with Homebrew
brew install tunnelite
tunnelite http://localhost:3000
```

You can also install the [.NET tool](#net-tool) or download a [standalone binary](#standalone-binaries).

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Exposing locally-hosted web applications to the internet for testing or demo purposes.
- Quickly sharing dev builds during hackathons.
- Testing and debugging webhook integrations.
- Providing internet access to services running behind firewalls without exposing incoming ports.

## 📦 Installation

### Homebrew

On macOS and Linux, install from [Homebrew Core](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tunnelite):

```bash
brew install tunnelite
```

Homebrew installs the required .NET dependency automatically. No additional tap is needed.

To update an existing installation:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade tunnelite
```

### .NET tool

Requires the .NET 10 SDK. To install Tunnelite as a global tool, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Tunnelite
```

To update an existing installation:

```bash
dotnet tool update --global Tunnelite
```

### Standalone binaries

Every [release](https://github.com/cristipufu/tunnelite/releases/latest) also ships a single self-contained executable, built with NativeAOT, that needs no .NET runtime installed:

| Platform | Archive |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x64 | `tunnelite-linux-x64.tar.gz` |
| Linux arm64 | `tunnelite-linux-arm64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | `tunnelite-osx-x64.tar.gz` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `tunnelite-osx-arm64.tar.gz` |
| Windows x64 | `tunnelite-win-x64.zip` |

A `SHA256SUMS` file is attached to each release for verification.

## 💻 Usage

Once installed, you can use the `tunnelite` command to create a tunnel to your local application:

```bash
tunnelite http://localhost:3000
```

This command returns a public URL with an auto-generated subdomain.

![The tunnelite CLI connecting a local application to a public URL](https://github.com/cristipufu/tunnelite/blob/master/docs/tunnelite-cli.gif?raw=true)

| Argument / option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<localUrl>` | The local URL to tunnel to. Use `http://` or `https://` for web applications, or `tcp://host:port` for raw TCP (self-hosted servers only). |
| `--publicUrl <url>` | The tunnel server to connect to. Defaults to `https://tunnelite.com`. |
| `--log <level>` | Client log verbosity: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error` or `Critical`. |

While the tunnel is running, press `c` to clear the screen and `q` to quit.

### Pair a phone with a desktop app

```bash
tunnelite serve http://127.0.0.1:2584 --name desktop
# Equivalent paired mode on the original command:
tunnelite http://127.0.0.1:2584 --pair --name desktop
```

Scan the terminal QR code with the phone's camera. The browser pairs once and opens the local app's web UI. The desktop must already serve a web UI/API; Tunnelite provides access to it. No phone-side VPN or Tunnelite app is required.

The code expires after five minutes and can enroll one browser. Press `p` for another code, `d` to list devices, and `r` to revoke a device. Revocation closes that device's active SSE/WebSocket streams. Browser sessions expire after 30 days. Redirected stdin also accepts `pair`, `devices`, `revoke <device-id>`, and `q` as lines.

`--name` selects a **local desktop profile**, not a custom public hostname. Its secret derives a stable `p-<id>.tunnelite.com` address that the relay can verify after a restart. Identity and device records live only on the desktop, under its application-data directory. Use `--identity-file <path>` to select a file explicitly. Unix profile files have owner-only permissions, and one CLI process can open a profile at a time. Keep the file to retain the address and paired browsers; losing it requires pairing again.

The relay needs **no disk, database, or external storage**: its connection maps and browser-verification keys are in memory. The desktop re-registers them on reconnect. Deploy the updated relay before using paired mode; protected clients refuse relays that do not advertise support. The existing single-node SignalR deployment is supported.

Public HTTPS terminates at the relay, which can read the traffic. Paired mode adds access control; it does not provide end-to-end encryption that hides traffic from the relay. Use HTTPS for the relay; HTTP is accepted only on loopback for local development.

For an ordinary public URL with a terminal QR code, use `tunnelite http://localhost:3000 --qr`.

Windows Terminal, PowerShell, cmd, macOS and Linux terminals are supported. The QR renderer detects Unicode and ANSI support, uses a text fallback for older consoles, and preserves a copyable URL when output is redirected or the terminal is too narrow. On Windows, desktop profiles use the current user's application-data folder and its inherited access controls.

## 🔍 How It Works

Tunnelite creates a bridge between your local application and the internet using a WebSocket connection. It streams incoming data from a public URL directly to your local server, making your local app accessible from anywhere.

The managed version of Tunnelite supports HTTP(S), WebSocket (WS/WSS) and Server-Sent Events tunneling. If you need TCP tunneling, you'll have to host the server yourself.

### HTTP connection

    participant AS as Azure SignalR
    participant TC as Tunneling Client
    participant IS as Intranet Server

    EC->>PTS: 1. HTTP Request
    PTS->>AS: 2. Notify Client (based on subdomain)

## 🏠 Self-Hosting

Tunnelite allows you to self-host the server, giving you full control over your tunneling infrastructure. To set up your own Tunnelite server, you'll need:

- Wildcard SSL certificate for your domain
- Wildcard DNS record pointing to your server's IP address

These allow Tunnelite to create secure subdomains for your tunnels and properly route traffic to your self-hosted server. The server project is `src/Tunnelite.Server`; the [deploy workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) shows how the managed instance is published to Azure App Service.

Once your server is up, point the client at it:

```bash
tunnelite http://localhost:3000 --publicUrl https://your-server-domain
```

## 📚 Packages

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Tunnelite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tunnelite/) | The `tunnelite` command-line tool. |
| [Tunnelite.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tunnelite.Sdk/) | `HttpTunnelClient` and `TcpTunnelClient` for opening tunnels from your own .NET code. |
| [Tunnelite.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tunnelite.AspNetCore/) | `app.UseTunnelite()` middleware that tunnels an ASP.NET Core app as soon as it starts. |

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseTunnelite(); // prints the public URL once the tunnel is connected

app.Run();
```

For an embedded desktop app, register a host-owned background service before building the app:

```csharp
using Tunnelite.AspNetCore;
using Tunnelite.Sdk;

// Load the same identity and device state from your desktop application's storage on each launch.
var identity = new TunnelIdentity(savedDesktopSecret);
using var access = new PairedAccess(identity, savedDeviceState, saveDeviceStateAsync);
builder.Services.AddTunnelite(options =>
{
    options.Access = access;
    options.OnReady = (client, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        ShowPairingQr(client.CreatePairingUrl());
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    };
});
```

`OnReady` runs after registration and reconnects. Render its URL using the host application's QR library. `access.State.Devices` lists enrolled browsers; `await access.RevokeAsync(deviceId)` revokes one. The asynchronous save callback runs before enrollment or revocation is acknowledged. `PairedAccessState` contains token hashes, not browser tokens. The host service starts after the local HTTP server and disposes the tunnel during shutdown. `PublicUrl` and `LocalUrl` can be configured in the same options.

Applications can also instantiate `HttpTunnelClient` directly with `HttpTunnelRequest.Access`. Use `await using` for the client and `ConnectAsync(cancellationToken)` for cancellable startup. Keep the local web server bound to loopback, and allow the public tunnel hostname in any host validation performed by your app.

## 🧪 Tests

`test/Tunnelite.Tests` starts the tunnel server and a local app in-process and drives real traffic through the tunnel: HTTP, Server-Sent Events, WebSockets (including large and fragmented messages), TCP, and a client speaking the original WebSocket wire format. Set `TUNNELITE_CLI` to a built `tunnelite` binary to also run the CLI end-to-end.

```bash
dotnet test test/Tunnelite.Tests
```

CI runs the suite on every pull request, plus a NativeAOT publish of the CLI that is tested the same way.
